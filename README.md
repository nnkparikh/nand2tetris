## nand2tetris ##

The reasons to do this project is best described by the 'why bother' section [here](http://www.nand2tetris.org/about.php):

"Because many CS students don't understand how computers work; because fewer and fewer students take compilation courses; 
because many computer architecture courses are too detailed and too dry; 
because nothing beats the thrill of creating something from almost nothing; 
because Nand2Tetris engages students in implementing some of the coolest algorithms, data structures and techniques in 
applied computer science, and because the typical student feedback in Nand2Tetris courses is 'the best course I ever took'."
